"""Deck management routes (extracted from main.py during the v4 reorg).

Covers the deck index, deck detail, card add/move/printing/tag operations,
intent/retag, pull/return, export, the cards-partial + panels HTMX fragments,
and the deck-scoped panels-cache helpers (whose read side the goldfish route
imports from here).

Behaviour is byte-identical to the pre-extraction handlers in main.py — this
move changes wiring only, not logic.

    the page came back in default order. **It was 17 routes, not one** — the
    reported action was just the one someone happened to use.

    The POST's own URL carries no query (the forms post to action paths), so the
