"""Every template must be RENDERED by some test, or be allowlisted with a reason.

**This guards a class, not an instance.** A template no test renders can drift
indefinitely, because prod's Jinja is permissive (#157): a missing context key
renders empty instead of raising, so nothing surfaces it. `import_preview.html`
read `row.location_type` — a key `parse_text_list` never emits — for months.
Nothing broke in prod; the gap only appeared when v4.13.23 finally loaded that
page in a test and the STRICT env raised on the first render.

Measured when this was written: **21 of 95 templates had never been rendered by
the suite**, including `_switch_printing_modal.html`, whose scroll bug had been
fixed the day before with a test that read the file as TEXT and never rendered
it, and `_collection_row.html`, which carries the `'%.2f'|format(...)` call
whose TEXT-column variant took `/pending` down in v4.13.12.

**Named `test_zz_` so it collects LAST.** The tracker is filled as other tests
render, so a guard that runs mid-alphabet sees a partial picture — the first
version of this file sat at `test_template_coverage.py` and duly reported
`watchlist.html` and `trade_new.html` as unrendered, because `test_trade_*` and
`test_watchlist_*` had not run yet. Same precedent as
`test_fk_parent_delete.py::test_zzz_print_red_matrix`.

**It SKIPS on a partial run.** `pytest tests/test_one_thing.py` renders almost
nothing, and a guard that fails there would train everyone to ignore it.

**The allowlist is meant to shrink.** Removing an entry is the unit of progress;
adding one requires saying why. The point is not a coverage percentage — it is
that every gap is a deliberate choice somebody wrote down.
